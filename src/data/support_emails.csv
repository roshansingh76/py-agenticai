E007,Feature Request: Offline Mode,"Hi there, I travel frequently for work and often don't have internet access.

Is this something you're considering?",david.miller@email.com,2024-01-18 15:45:00,Medium
E008,Performance Issue,"The app has become extremely slow since the last update. It takes 30+ seconds just to open, and switching between sections is laggy. I'm using iPhone 12 Pro with iOS 17.

E014,DATA DELETED - HELP!!!,"ALL MY DATA IS GONE! After updating to version 2.1.3, the app deleted everything. MONTHS of work lost! There was no backup option, no warning, nothing.

Thanks!",brian.martin@email.com,2024-01-23 14:00:00,Medium

E019,Search Functionality Improvement,"The current search feature is quite basic and slow. It would be great if you could improve it with: 1) Faster search results 2) Advanced filters 3) Search within attachments 4) Search history.
